We are looking to plug multiple instances of gsuite google calendar into a bubble app. The goal is to import ALL of a companies calendar data for all their gsuite users. This will require certain permissions given on a calendars admins end, but once that is given, we want this API to keep our bubble apps database in sync with the calendar itself. Timing on sync refreshes TBD. We need a developer with: - extensive api build experience - knowledge of googles calendar api - someone who can mate this with a Bubble database
